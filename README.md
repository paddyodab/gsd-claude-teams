# gsd-claude-teams

Multi-developer adaptation for [Get Shit Done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) (GSD) — the AI-powered project execution framework for Claude Code.

GSD is designed for a single developer. This layer adds per-developer state isolation and team coordination commands so multiple engineers can work on different phases of the same project simultaneously.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** installed and working
2. **Vanilla GSD** installed:
   ```bash
   npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
   # Interactive — choose global install, Claude Code
   ```

### Install

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> ~/gsd-claude-teams
node ~/gsd-claude-teams/scripts/install.js
```

That's it. The script:
- Backs up your vanilla GSD install
- Symlinks the team-adapted version in its place
- Installs four team coordination commands
- Runs a smoke test to verify

To uninstall and restore vanilla GSD:
```bash
node ~/gsd-claude-teams/scripts/install.js --uninstall
```

To update after someone pushes changes:
```bash
cd ~/gsd-claude-teams && git pull
# Done — the symlink means you're already running the latest
```

## What GSD Does (30-Second Version)

GSD turns a project idea into a structured execution plan and helps you build it phase by phase. The workflow:

1. **`/gsd:new-project`** — Describe what you're building. GSD creates PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, and a phased ROADMAP.md
2. **`/gsd:plan-phase`** — For each phase, GSD researches the approach and writes detailed implementation plans
3. **`/gsd:execute-phase`** — GSD executes the plans: writes code, runs tests, commits. You review
4. **`/gsd:verify-work`** — Validate the built features work correctly

All artifacts live in `.planning/` in your repo. Plans are committed so anyone can see what was built and why.

## What This Layer Adds

Vanilla GSD uses a single `STATE.md` to track progress. If two developers both run GSD, they overwrite each other's state. This layer solves that.

### Per-Developer State Isolation

Each developer gets their own state file (`STATE_pat.md`, `STATE_dustin.md`, etc.) while sharing the project's roadmap, requirements, and plans. When you run GSD commands, they read *your* state file — not a shared one.

### Team Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/team:assign pat 3` | Claim phase 3 as your own. Creates your state file, optionally creates a branch |
| `/team:status` | Show who's working on what across all developers |
| `/team:handoff` | Verify your work, normalize artifacts, create a PR to main |
| `/team:pickup 3` | Pick up a phase someone else started — get briefed on progress and what's next |

## Workflow for Engineers

### First Time Setup

```
1. Install (see Quick Start above)
2. Clone the project repo your team is working on
3. In Claude Code, run: /team:assign <your-name>
```

### Daily Workflow

**Starting a new phase:**
```
/team:assign <your-name> <phase-number>    # claim the phase
/gsd:plan-phase                            # plan it (or skip if already planned)
/gsd:execute-phase                         # build it
/gsd:verify-work                           # validate it works
/team:handoff                              # PR to main
```

**Picking up someone else's work:**
```
/team:pickup <phase-number>                # checks out branch, briefs you on status
/gsd:execute-phase                         # continue execution
```

**Checking in on the team:**
```
/team:status                               # who's on what, what's done, what's blocked
```

### Parallel Work

Multiple developers can work on different phases at the same time:

- Pat plans and executes Phase 2
- Greg plans and executes Phase 3
- Dustin plans and executes Phase 4

This works because each phase has its own directory under `.planning/phases/` and each developer has their own state file. No collisions.

**The one rule: one developer per phase.** Don't have two people executing the same phase simultaneously.

### Session Management

GSD is context-aware across sessions. If you need to stop and come back later:

```
/gsd:pause-work         # saves your context for later
# ... next day ...
/gsd:resume-work        # picks up where you left off
```

Or just run `/gsd:progress` — it reads your state file and tells you what to do next.

## How It Works Under the Hood

GSD hardcodes `.planning/STATE.md` in ~90 workflow files. Rather than forking GSD, we maintain a build-time transform (`scripts/transform.js`) that rewrites state file paths to support per-developer isolation while keeping shared artifacts (ROADMAP.md, PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md) in the common `.planning/` root.

```

## Known Limitations

- **`/gsd:update` will overwrite the adapted files.** If you run GSD's built-in updater, it replaces the symlink with fresh vanilla files. Fix: re-run `node scripts/install.js`.
- **Moving the gsd-claude-teams repo breaks the symlink.** Fix: re-run `node scripts/install.js`.
- **`/gsd:complete-milestone` should be run by one person** after all developers' phases are done — not while someone is still executing.
